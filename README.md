## About Me

I'm a passionate backend engineer focused on building scalable, secure, and cloud-ready backend systems. My expertise spans across developing robust APIs, optimizing database performance, implementing microservices architecture, and deploying solutions to cloud platforms.

I am advancing my backend journey through the **ALX ProDev Backend Program**, and growing my cloud skills through the **ALX Cloud Program**, where I work with AWS cloud services.

My goal is to build impactful backend solutions, collaborate on meaningful projects, and contribute to creating reliable, high-performance systems that serve millions of users.
